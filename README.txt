PREREQUISITES:


DESCRIPTION:

This is a basic intrusion response system simulation program where users can select and add teqchniques to the simulation to see log events occur and receive a response on what the system should do.


RUN AND NAVIGATION INTRUCTIONS:
1] To run the program open the folder where it was downloaded/saved in the terminal go to intrusion_response folder and use the command [COPY/PASTE]
	
	python client.py 	*OR*	python3 client.py

2] Or open folder in an IDE and simply press the run program button
3] To navigate between simulation tab and management tab simply select the tabs on the User Interface


SIMULATION TAB INSTRUCTIONS:
1] Simply select which attack to simulate and press the START SIMULATION button and the information will be generated including a randomly generated IP in the log display

2] To stop the simulation, simply press the STOP SIMULATION button and the simulation events will be logged in the database


MANAGEMENT TAB INTRUCTIONS:
1] To add a technique simply fill out the information desired in the appropriate boxes [NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT FORMATTING ALL OF IT IS TAKEN CARE OF IN WHEN SUBMITTING]

2] Then once all of the information is filled in for a new technique simply select the add technique button and the new technique will now be displayed in the technique display and recorded in the database to be used for future use, automatically updating the simulation page to provide a simulation for the new technique [NOTE: IF ANY OF THE INFORMATION IS MISSING THAT IS REQUIRED AND ERROR MESSAGE WILL POP UP]


NETWORK VISUAL TAB INSTRUCTIONS:
1] All you need to do is press the GENERATE NETWORK button to visualize a topography of a network 

EXIT INSTRUCTIONS:
1] When ready to close program you can click the X button on the window bar or conveniently on all tabs there is a close button at the bottom


FUNCTINALITY AND STRUCTURE:

#This application uses Tkinter for its GUI components with a classic intentional Windows 95 feel, it also utilizes SQLite for the database with tables to store techniques and log events


#Key features include: 

	- Predefined intrusion techniques
	- Severity classifications [LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL] utilizing DEFCON levels as a nod to the Pentagon
	- Dynamic technique addition
	- Simulation of network intrusion scenarios
	- Event logging and tracking
	- Visualization of a network


POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS:
[NOTE: MOST IMPROVEMENTS ARE OUT OF THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT; BUT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED OUTSIDE OF COURSE]

1] Advanced Simulation Capabilities

	-Implement more complex attack simulation scenarios
	-Add randomized attack complexity
	-Develop more detailed response strategies

2] Reporting and Analytics

	- Generate comprehensive PDF reports
	- Create data visualization for attack trends
	- Implement export functionality for logs and techniques

3] User Authentication

	- Add login system for different user roles
	- Implement access control for technique management

4] User Experience Improvements

	- Dark/light mode toggle
	- Customizable interface themes
	- More intuitive UI design
	- Tooltips and help documentation within the application

5] Security Features

	- Real-time threat intelligence integration
	- Machine learning-based threat prediction
	- Enhanced logging and audit trail mechanisms

[Limitations]

	- Current version is a simulation tool
	- Requires manual technique input
	- Limited to predefined simulation scenarios
